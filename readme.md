Hi everyone!

Just wanted to share that I'm starting The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript path! I'm excited to dive deeper into web development and learn new skills that will help me build great projects in the future. I'll be working on everything from front-end design to back-end functionality using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Wish me luck on this new journey, and feel free to join me if you're also interested in improving your web development skills!
